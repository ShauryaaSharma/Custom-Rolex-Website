<p class="bodys">The Rolex collection offers a wide range of prestigious, high-precision timepieces, from Professional to Classic models to suit any wrist.</p>

<h2 class="headings">Date Just</h2>
<a href="./gallery.html"><img class="images" src="/img/Date Just.jpg" alt="Datejust Rolex" width="500"></a><br>
<h3 class="headings">No one day is like another</h3>
<p class="bodys">Any day can leave a lasting mark on our lives and set the stage for new aspirations. Since its creation in 1945, the Datejust has continued to reinvent itself while symbolizing Rolex’s definition of classic elegance. A milestone in watchmaking history, it was the first self-winding waterproof chronometer wristwatch to feature a window displaying the date. Magnified by the Cyclops lens, these numbers are a reminder that though 24 hours mark a day, it’s on us to make those a date to remember.</p>
<i><b><p class="bodys">"This is the pinnacle of watchmaking science. It encapsulates every discovery made to date"</p></b></i>

<h2 class="headings">Submarine</h2>
<a href="/Submariner.html"><img class="images" src="/img/Submariner.jpg " alt="Submarine Rolex" width="500"></a>
<h3 class="headings">Beneath the surface</h3>
<p class="bodys">Launched in 1953, the Rolex Submariner is the first divers’ wristwatch to be waterproof to a depth of 100 metres (330 feet) – now 300 metres (1,000 feet). Its major features, such as the graduated rotatable bezel, the luminescent display, the large hands and hour markers, have been a driving force in the creation of the long line of Rolex divers’ watches which followed.</p>
<p class="bodys">The Submariner is an iconic timepiece whose renown now extends beyond the professional world it was first designed for. The Submariner, the ultimate standard.</p>
<i><b><p class="bodys">"I was wearing a Submariner the first time I saw the Titanic for real through the porthole of a submersible, and I was wearing the same watch in my black tie when I went up on the stage to get the Oscar for directing Titanic."</p></b></i>

<h2 class="headings">GMT-Master2</h2>
<a href="/gallery 3.html"><img class="images" src="/img/GMTM2.webp" alt="GMT-Master2 Rolex" width="500"></a>
<h3 class="headings">Here and there</h3>
<p class="bodys">The GMT-Master II is the ultimate cosmopolitan watch. With a dedicated 24-hour hand and a 24-hour graduated two-colour rotatable bezel, it displays a second time zone in addition to the conventional time. At a glance, the wearer can see the time in their current location and in another part of the world, giving them a strengthened connection with their own personal ‘somewhere out there’, be it a special place or memory, or plans for a future journey.</p>
<p class="bodys"><i><b><u>"A privileged witness to advances in aviation that have brought people together and transformed society."</u></b></i></p>

<h3 class="headings">A new day begins</h3>
<p class="bodys">If time changes all things, this minute changes them more than the others. When midnight strikes, the Day-Date forms a bridge between past and future, between what has been achieved and what remains to be lived. Since 1956, it has borne witness to the greatest moments in history on the wrist of visionaries, virtuosos and pioneers. Those who make each day a promise for the future.</p>
<p class="bodys"><i><b><u>"Dates and days are essential."</u></b></i></p>

<h2 class="headings">Cosmograph Daytona</h2>
<a href="/gallery 5.html"><img class="images" src="/img/cosmograph-daytona.jpeg" alt="Cosmograph Daytona Rolex" width="500"></a>
<h3 class="headings">Watch or legend?</h3>
<p class="bodys">Launched in 1963, the Cosmograph Daytona has long since transcended its status in the world of watchmaking to become an icon. Its name, inextricably linked to the famous racetrack, as well as its graphic face, have made it a legend. Yet it is at the heart of this exceptional chronograph that the true mechanics of the legend beat: a movement designed and produced entirely by the Rolex Manufacture that delivers superlative performance in all circumstances. Constantly improved and refined over time, the Cosmograph Daytona has proved to be as reliable as it is precise</p>
<p class="bodys"><i><u><b>"You must stay calm but you must also act and not be afraid; you must go forward courageously."</b></u></i></p>

<h2 class="headings">Oyster Perpetual</h2>
<a href="/gallery 6.html"><img class="images" src="/img/Oyster Perpetual.avif" alt="Oyster Perpetual Rolex" width="500"></a>
<h3 class="headings">Freedom of movement</h3>
<p class="bodys">As the purest expression of Rolex’s manufacturing spirit, the Oyster Perpetual was designed for those who see the world as having boundless possibilities. As the quintessential wristwatch, it carries the brand’s founding legacy while following the movement of its era. Reliable on every count, the Oyster Perpetual withstands the demands of contemporary life and makes way for endless future possibilities that are ours to pursue.</p>
<p class="bodys"><i><u><b>"Oyster Perpetual watches stand out with dials in subtle or vibrant colours, ensuring that they always sport a contemporary look."</b></u></i></p>

<h2 class="headings">Yacht-Master</h2>
<a href="/gallery 7.html"><img class="images" src="/img/Yacht-Master.webp" alt="Yacht-Master Rolex" width="500"></a>
<h3 class="headings">Mapping invisible routes</h3>
<p class="bodys">For those at sea, staying on course is a constant challenge. When dealing with the elements, nothing is certain and constant reaction is required to stay in the right direction. Since its launch in 1992, the Oyster Perpetual Yacht-Master has been equipped with a bidirectional rotatable bezel that facilitates the calculation and reading of navigational time. Elegantly combining functionality and nautical style, this watch has made its mark well beyond its professional realm.</p>
<p class="bodys"><i><u><b>"This Yacht-Master 42, which is an outstanding nautical watch, is also proof of Rolex’s firm commitment to yachting."</b></u></i></p>

<h2 class="headings">Sea-Dweller</h2>
<a href="https://www.rolex.com/watches/sea-dweller"><img class="images" src="/img/Sea-Dweller.jpeg" alt="Sea-Dweller Rolex" width="500"></a>
<h3 class="headings">Rising to the challenge of decompression</h3>
<p class="bodys">Rolex created the Oyster Perpetual Sea‑Dweller in 1967 to meet the challenge of prolonged underwater missions. Subsequently improved in close partnership with Comex (Compagnie Maritime d'Expertises) professionals, it is now waterproof to 1,220 metres (4,000 feet). The Sea‑Dweller is specifically designed for saturation diving. Thanks to its helium escape valve, it can withstand decompression on ascent and master the return to the surface – the final phase of deep-sea exploration.</p>
<p class="bodys"><i><u><b>"Gradually releasing interior pressure when the need arises."</b></u></i></p>

<hr>
<h2 class="headings">Deep Sea</h2>
<a href="/gallery 2.html"><img class="images" src="/img/Deep Sea.jpeg" alt="Deep Sea Rolex" width="500"></a>
<h3 class="headings">The Rolex Deepsea and the Deepsea Challenge were specifically designed for those who push the boundaries of underwater exploration.</h3>
<p class="bodys">Symbols of the long shared history between Rolex and deep-sea explorers, the Oyster Perpetual Rolex Deepsea and Oyster Perpetual Deepsea Challenge models are ultra-resistant professional divers’ watches. They are waterproof to a depth of 3,900 metres (12,800 feet) for the Rolex Deepsea, launched in 2008, and 11,000 metres (36,090 feet) for the Deepsea Challenge, presented in 2022.</p>
<p class="bodys"><i><u><b>"The Rolex Deepsea meets the most exacting requirements of professional divers in its resistance to pressure, precision and reliability."</b></u></i></p>

<h2 class="headings">Air-King</h2>
<a href="https://www.rolex.com/watches/air-king"><img class="images" src="/img/Air-King.jpeg" alt="Air-King Rolex" width="500"></a>
<h3 class="headings">A spirit of freedom</h3>
<p class="bodys">Immediately recognizable by its black dial featuring large 3, 6 and 9 hour markers and a prominent minutes scale, the Air‑King continues Rolex’s long association with aviation which dates back to the 1930s. More than a tribute, this robust and sporty watch, donned with a 40 mm Oystersteel case, symbolizes the fearlessness of aviation pioneers. It encourages each of us to release our adventurous spirit and soar.</p>
<p class="bodys"><i><u><b>"The peculiar qualities of this Rolex watch render it eminently suitable for flying purposes and I propose to use it on all my long-distance flights in the future."</b></u></i></p>

<h2 class="headings">Explorer</h2>
<a href="https://www.rolex.com/watches/explorer"><img class="images" src="/img/Explorer.jpeg" alt="Explorer Rolex" width="500"></a>
<h3 class="headings">Legible and durable, Explorer and Explorer II watches are designed to accompany those who push back the boundaries of human knowledge.</h3>
<p class="bodys">Since the 1930s, Rolex has been able to test its models in real conditions by equipping polar and mountaineering expeditions. The Oyster Perpetual Explorer and Oyster Perpetual Explorer II evolved from the brand’s deep involvement with exploration. Robust, reliable and accurate, these watches are capable of going where few dare to tread.</p>
<p class="bodys"><i><u><b>"Reliable and legible under all circumstances, the Explorer is one of Rolex’s first tool watches."</b></u></i></p>

<a href="https://www.rolex.com/watches/lady-datejust"><img class="images" src="/img/Lady-Datejust.webp" alt="Lady-Datejust Rolex" width="500"></a>
<h3 class="headings">Graceful elegance</h3>
<p class="bodys">This is how some may describe our Oyster Perpetual Lady‑Datejust. Maybe they’re right. Since the early 20th century, Rolex has designed and crafted watches suited for the wrists of every woman, with the same standard of excellence as all the models that have built its legend. So, if “classic” means always pursuing a higher standard, if it means perpetuating tradition while combining elegance with precision, grace with resistance, beauty with performance… then the Lady-Datejust is, indeed, a classic timepiece designed for a lady.</p>
<p class="bodys"><i><u><b>"A classic timepiece, designed for a lady."</b></u></i></p>

<a href="https://www.rolex.com/watches/1908"><img class="images" src="/img/1908.jpg" alt="1908 Rolex" width="500"></a>
<h3 class="headings">A new milestone</h3>
